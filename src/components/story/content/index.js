    title: 'First time we met',
    body: 'Sherilyn and Seiji first crossed paths through a mutual friend in 2012 when Seiji was visiting Oahu. Seiji\'s first memory of Sherilyn was when she was the designated driver after a night of drinks. He distinctly remembers her telling everyone she isn\'t a good driver and feared for his life. Thankfully, they were able to stop by Jack in the Box for some munchies and make it home safely. On the other hand, Sherilyn didn\'t have any specific memory of Seiji from the first time they met except as someone\'s friend... üò≠',

    title: 'We dated',
    body: 'In 2016, Sherilyn and Seiji rekindled their friendship on another of Seiji\'s trips to Oahu. This time around, they spent a whole day together up in the North Shore, where they ate some garlic shrimp, acai bowls, and visited the Dole Plantation. More importantly, they stayed in touch even after Seiji left for home. A year later, they officially started dating. It wasn\'t easy starting off in a long-distance relationship, but with countless nights of FaceTime and trips to see each other, they built a strong bond and commitment to each other. In 2019, Seiji moved to Oahu to be with Sherilyn all the time ‚ù§Ô∏è ',

    title: 'We got engaged',
    body: 'On a summer weekend in 2020, Seiji suggested going on the Koko Head hike; a hike they do once a year as a tradition. On this particular climb up the trail, Seiji was struggling and out of breath due to his COVID mask (at least that\'s his excuse üòÇ). As they reached the top of the hike and was getting their picture taken, Seiji got down on his knee and popped the question. Being so nervous and tired, he forgot everything he was going to say to her and almost put the ring on the wrong hand üòÖ. Luckily, Sherilyn still said yes!',
